#### Forking the repository

The first step would be to [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository). This will allow you to get a current copy of the repository state. Follow the steps to also clone your forked repository locally.

All new branches should be created from `main`. PRs would be requested to `main` branch. An approval from a team member is required before merging.

#### Installing Node and Yarn

The Safe React Hooks uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) as development environment and Yarn to manage the dependencies. You will need to make sure you are using the [latest Node LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) and that you have available Yarn v1.

You can check which versions you are using with:

```bash
node -v
yarn -v
```

#### Installing dependencies    

Install all dependencies and build the whole project by using the following commands at the project root.

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

#### Running the tests

```bash
yarn test
```

#### Submitting a pull request

From the forked repository you can [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the original repository. Make sure to select the `safe-global:development` branch as the target branch.
